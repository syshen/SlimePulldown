The source code is modified from dbsGen's SlimeRefresh, which is a variant version of iOS6 UIRefreshControl. But different to SlimeRefresh, my main purpose is to re-use SlimeRefresh's outstanding animation effect, and provide another way for users to close a modal view in iPhone. 

In iPhone5, the screen size is a little bit large to me. But when we are developing an app, we normally put the close button or back button in the left side of navigation bar (top-left corner in the screen), which is difficult to touch if we operate iPhone with single hand. So, here I am creating an experiment to simulate if I can close a modal view by pulling it down. You can see the effect from the video below:
